# Motherly 

By Sharnaya Penate


I love my kids the most.

They told me that im thier best host.

I know i will be lost without them.

So i just have to hum.

A song they love to hear. 

Cause that all that they can bare.

I know they love me with all thier hearts.

And nothing can ever tear us apart.
